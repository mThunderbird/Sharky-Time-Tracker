# Sharky-Time-Tracker
Software for a time-tracking machine, created to help my school conduct simple physics experiments.

The software is designed for a machine that receives input from an unknown source - whatever the experiment requires.
It supports 3 different modes, selectable by a keypad: start/finish time, multiple finish times, lap time tracking.
